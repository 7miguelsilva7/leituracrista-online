<h2 id="ready-to-die-0">Ready to Die</h2>

<p>The gunmen asked for &quot;those who believe in God&quot; to stand up. Then the killer pointed his gun at Cassie Bernall and asked her the life-or-death question: &quot;Do you believe in Jesus?&quot; After a long hesitation, she looked to the young man, and said: &quot;Yes, I love Jesus&quot;. That was the last thing this 17-year-old Christian would ever say. The gunman asked her &quot;Why?&quot; She had no time to answer before she was shot to death.</p>

<p>Many students were at Columbine High School in Denver, USA, when the tragedy began. What they saw made them very afraid! Thirteen boys and girls were shot to death and many others were injured by bullets and bombs when two of their schoolmates, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, entered the school shooting other students. When the police arrived, there was not much they could do. Eric and Dylan had killed themselves. After all they did, 13 other people were dead.</p>

<p>Why they did that, was the question in everyone&#039;s mind. The answer is that they acted on what was inside of them &ndash; sin. God warns us, &quot;Because sentence [punishment] against an evil work is not executed [carried out] speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.&quot; Ecclesiastes 8:11. Every one of us has an evil heart inside, and there is only one way to change that evil heart &ndash; being given a &quot;new&quot; heart. That is easily seen from from the testimony of one of the survivors: &quot;You could hear them laughing as they ran down the hallways shooting people. He put a gun in my face and said, &quot;I&#039;m doing this because people made fun of me last year.&#039;- &#039;&#039; She escaped unshot but splattered with a fellow student&#039;s blood.</p>

<p>God hates sin, whether it is a simple thing like secretly stealing your brother&#039;s chocolate bar, or a serious thing like killing your fellow students at school. He will punish sin too. There will be death and after death judgment for every one who has not had their sins forgiven by the Lord Jesus Christ. &quot;It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many.&quot; Hebrews 9:27, 28. But the Lord Jesus loves us, and took the punishment that we deserve. He paid the penalty for those who are sorry about their sins and come to Him for forgiveness. &quot;Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.&quot; 1 Peter 3:18. The Lord Jesus gives those who come to Him for forgiveness a new heart &ndash; a heart that loves to do what is right, as well as the power to do what is right even when tempted to do something wrong.</p>

<p>Did you know that even worse times are coming? When Eric and Dylan went on killing the other students, everyone around them was frightened. Many were able to escape the building helped by the authorities. Soon the Lord Jesus is coming to call to Himself all who trust in Him. Then there will no authorities to restrain evil and protect people. Men will kill and steal as they choose, and things will be so terrible that people will &quot;seek death, and shall not find it.&quot; Revelation 9:6. There will be no escape! Will you be with Jesus in heaven then, or will you have to live through that terrible, terrible time that will last much longer than those moments at school? &quot;Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.&quot; 2 Corinthians 6:2.</p>

<p>This girl&#039;s family, although sad at their loss, knew that their daughter had put her trust in Jesus, the Son of God. &quot;Cassie&#039;s response does not surprise us,&quot; the family said in a statement released at her funeral. &quot;Her life was rightly centered around our Lord Jesus. It was for her strong faith in God and His promise of eternal life that made her stand&quot;.</p>

<p>According to a report written by Jay Grelen, Newhouse News Service, the day after the massacre of 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High, Cassie Bernall&#039;s parents found a note in her room. Cassie printed it in neat, bold letters. She didn&#039;t date the note, but in light of what had happened, the note was haunting and prescient, as if Cassie knew something no one else knew, as if she knew she had been born for this purpose:</p>

<p>&quot;Now I have given up on everything else &ndash; I have found it to be the only way to really know Christ and to experience the mighty power that brought Him back to life again, and to find out what it means to suffer and to be with Him. So, whatever it takes, I will be one who lives in the fresh awareness of life of those who are alive from the dead.&quot; (from the Star-Ledger, Newark NJ, Monday April 26 1999).</p>

<p>When Cassie died, she was taken to be with her blessed Saviour. Her death can be a warning to others to turn to God and trust the Lord Jesus as their Savior. To be prepared for eternity. Are you ready like Cassie was to meet God if your life should end today? All who have trusted in Jesus are waiting to hear His call to come up to heaven to be with and like Him forever. &quot;Be ye therefore ready&quot; (Luke 12:40).</p>

<h2 id="a-message-from-a-reader">A message from a reader:</h2>

<p>I would just like to give my condolences to the families, friends, and community. I am 13 years old and our middle school have lost 3 students this year. I can relate to what most are feeling.People are talking about IF parents kept away guns from their children &ndash; or something like this &ndash; probably wouldn&#039;t happen. But IF is a big word. No matter what you do IF you took away the guns and other weapons from children, they are still going to have sin. Only GOD can take THAT away.</p>

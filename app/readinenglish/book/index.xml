      <description>A Blessed Blunder At a gospel meeting in Des Moines I had preached as clearly as I could the glorious Word of the Christ of the cross. Afterward, noticing a young man trying to avoid me, I went straight over to him.
After a brief conversation I persuaded him to come with me into a small adjoining room. I learned that it was through a “mistake” that he had “blundered” into the meeting.</description>

      <description>A Changed Life That which occurred seemed like a nightmare, but it was not. Once I was a healthy and strong man; but I became disabled. Another transformation was about to take place in a way I never would have imagined.
It was August 8, 1987 when I had a drastic change in my life. I was passing by a bar and decided to go in for a drink. I was not aware that there was a man inside who wanted to kill me.</description>

      <description>A Daring Challenge There lived in Germany years ago a countess of the House of Hanover. She was a noted unbeliever, especially opposed to the teaching of resurrection and eternal life.
This descendant of royalty died when about thirty years old. Before she passed away she gave written orders that her grave should be covered with a solid granite slab; that around it should be fitted square blocks of stone; and that the corners should be fastened to each other and to the granite slab by heavy iron clamps.</description>

      <description>A Home Higher than Mountains It was New Year&amp;#039;s Day when the drums and flutes began to play. Now, three days later, the drums continued to boom out their rhythms and the flutes kept playing their short, shrill tunes over and over. Men and women from a town high in the Andes Mountains had been dancing up and dawn the streets for all three days. They were so tired that they could hardly keep on dancing, but still they did not stop.</description>

      <description>A Man of His Word During the French-English war years ago, an English general was planning an attack. He ordered the officer whose duty it was to provide the troops with food to have the rations ready and at a certain place named by him at twelve o’clock on the following day.
It was sometimes difficult to provide sufficient supplies; and the officer replied that the rations could not be at the place on such short notice.</description>

      <description>A True Shark Story
In that playful marine acrobat, the porpoise, the shark has an enemy that will permit no intrusion on its feeding grounds. This fact came out in the course of a story told about themselves by two old and experienced Christian fishermen while conducting a fishing excursion off Swan Beach, New Jersey, many years ago. The story which appeared first in Harper’s Weekly was as follows: “Some ten years ago we were hard drinkers, swearers, wild surfmen and fishermen.</description>

The “Patrick Morris” was a large ferry boat which carried passengers and cars across the strait between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The captain was justly proud of his boat which had made the trip safely many times.
One day while the ferry was in the harbor at Port aux Basques, a violent storm came up. The waves in the strait rolled high as the wind blew harder and harder.</description>

      <description>A stealthy attack from a hidden enemy When I was in junior high school, my uncle invited me and some of my friends over to his house for supper. For dessert, among other things, was a plate of figs. Yum! Figs and dates and raisins are my favorite dried fruits. They come originally from mid-east countries like Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, among others.
While we were eating the figs, one of the boys said to my uncle, &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve been studying about bacteria at school.</description>

The two girls had been walking together when they noticed a small white board fastened to the trunk of a tree. On it were printed the words: “AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT.</description>

      <description>An Irish Soldier’s Sacrifice In a cemetery on the Aisne River, in France, is the grave of a soldier. It is marked only by a simple cross, with no name; but it has upon it an inscription that arrests the attention of the passer-by.
During World War 1, this unknown soldier was a private of the Royal Irish Guards. A corporal of the West Yorkshire Regiment, who was in a hospital at Woolrich, told the story of the unknown hero who was buried with full military honors, his fellow-soldiers erecting the cross over his grave, and inscribing upon it the words—”He saved others; himself he could not save.</description>

      <description>Anchored The 16,000 ton tanker “British Sportsman” was berthed at an oil dock in Antwerp, Belgium. Her cargo, three million gallons of crude oil from Kuwait on the Persian Gulf, had just been unloaded. Preparatory for her return journey and to make the vessel easier to handle on the high seas, the emptied oil tanks were being filled with water for ballast.
It was miserable weather in late fall. The air was beginning to turn cold and rain was annoyingly frequent.</description>

      <description>Are You Acquainted With the Author “I am personally acquainted with the author.” That was the reply of a Christian when challenged by a skeptic as to the authenticity of the Bible.
There are many who have Bibles but have no personal acquaintance with the Author! How many there are who regard the Bible as merely a masterpiece of English literature, or perhaps go as far as to call it, “The good Book.</description>

      <description>Arrested by a Song It was a busy scene at an American railroad station. The train was late and the waiting room crowded.
One loud-voiced man seemed to take pleasure in constantly cursing using the name of Christ, to the intense disgust of many of the passengers. But regardless of the discomfort he caused, the man kept on.
Presently, above the voice of the swearer, rose the beautiful words of a hymn sung in a manly voice:</description>

      <description>Between Two Slides Catastrophic snow-slides are not uncommon in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Suddenly and without warning, massive build-ups of snow take off rapidly down the mountain sides, overcoming or burying everything in their paths. One such slide buried a British Columbia motel and gasoline station, killing several people, in 1974. A short time later a skier died there beneath an avalanche. During one fateful week in March years ago over eight hundred people are said to have died in Rocky Mountain snowstorms and slides.</description>

He was sick, at sea, and he knew he had little time left. He was afraid of death and of the eternity beyond it. The captain sent for his first mate and said, “Williams, I need you to pray for me. You know I’ve been a godless and harsh man, and I know I’m not going to make it this time.</description>

View Him bleeding on the tree,
Pouring out His life for thee.
Weary sinner, keep your eyes
On the atoning Sacrifice:
There the Lord upon the tree
Numbered with transgressors see.
Cast your guilty soul on Him;
Find Him mighty to redeem;
At His feet your burden lay —
Look your doubts and fears away.</description>

      <description>Christ is coming “Sit Thou at My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool” (Psalm 110:1). God the Father spoke these words to His beloved Son as He entered heaven with the marks of the world’s hatred on His blessed person.
Nearly 2,000 years have come and gone since then, and time, with lightning speed, rushes us toward that awful moment when the Son will rise up in unopposed power to fulfill the Father’s decree.</description>

      <description>Does God exist? The existence of God cannot be proved or disproved. The Bible says that we must accept by faith the fact that God exists: “And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him” (Hebrews 11:6). If God so desired, He could simply appear and prove to the whole world that He exists.</description>

“The Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). “His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men” (Psalm 11:4). “Thou understandest my thought afar off” (Psalm 139:2). “I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins” (Jeremiah 17:10).
Would you and I like our inner history to be published or revealed? God’s X-rays reveal all. And if sin is not blotted out by atonement, the “plates” as it were will come up for judgment.</description>

One morning he went out on his dangerous errand and, looking down from the summit, he saw a ledge jutting out from the rock below covered with a cluster of birds’ nests. He fastened his rope to a tree which stood near the edge, and then gradually let himself down to the edge of the rock.</description>

The mighty power of the simple truth contained in Anna B. Warner’s “Jesus loves me,” is shown in the following true story— the personally related experience of “a woman that was a sinner.”
She told it to the preacher following a gospel meeting during which he had noted the rapt attention of the woman unknown to him, and heard her irrepressible “Amen!</description>

      <description>Just Lippen to Jesus In the broad Scotch translation of the New Testament, the word “lippen” is used for the English word “believe.” For example, John 3:16 reads: “For God se loved the world as to gie His Son, the only begotten ane, that like ane wha lippen till him sudna dee, but has life for aye.” We are more used to, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</description>

She knew that she was a sinner in the sight of God, and she was anxious about her soul’s future. But like many, instead of simply believing on Christ and resting on the finished work which He had already done at Calvary, she thought she must do something, pray more earnestly, and plead anxiously in order to get the forgiveness of sins.</description>

The great Amazon River pours out so mighty a stream of fresh water into the Atlantic that near its mouth, for miles out of sight of land, a deep layer of fresh water covers the ocean. Many years ago a sailing ship left Eu­rope for a South American port, and due to storms it took so long that the water on board began to give out.</description>

No, He does not say, They shall never wander; He does not say, They shall never backslide; He does not say, They shall never stumble, but He does say, “They shall never PERISH.</description>

      <description>New York World Trade Center Under Attack! Tuesday, September 11, 2001. It is 8:45 a.m. in New York City. The morning sun hits the twin towers of World Trade Center, where thousands of people are working. Suddenly American Airlines Flight 11 Boeing 767, hijacked by terrorists, slams into the north tower of the World Trade Center. The airplane was en route from Boston&amp;#039;s Logan Airport to Los Angeles International with 92 people onboard.</description>

      <description>Only One Church John Wesley once, in a dream, found himself at the gates of hell. He knocked, and asked who were within.
“Are there any Roman Catholics here?” he asked.
“Yes,” was the answer.
“Any Presbyterians?” he asked, and again the answer was, “Yes.”
“Are there any Welseyans here?”
“Yes, we have some of those, too,” came the answer.
Disappointed and dismayed, especially by the last reply, he turned his step upward and at last came to the gates of heaven.</description>

      <description>Pull Me Up Janet! Janet had a “drinking problem.” Her neighbors knew it; her husband knew it. Janet herself knew it, but she just couldn’t overcome it.
One night as she wandered in the streets, disgusted with herself and miserably unhappy, she overheard a preacher speaking on John 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</description>

      <description>Put My Finger There Feeble and blind, the old man in a nursing home knew his life was fast slipping away. One great worry tormented his mind: What can I do to be saved? Poor man, what could he do to be saved? He could only lie there and fret because of his helplessness.
He had a little granddaughter who often came in to read to him, and one day she brought her Bible.</description>

      <description>Ready for The Race In the late afternoon of October 30, 1987, just after I had become 19, there were many young people in my snack bar. Until that afternoon, I had been a normally healthy young man. My life existed in entertainment, partying, games and girls. I thought my life would not have any meaning without pleasure and entertainment; so I had no concern about my future. But the future about which I had given no thought was about to have a tragic beginning for me that day.</description>

      <description>Ready to Die The gunmen asked for &amp;quot;those who believe in God&amp;quot; to stand up. Then the killer pointed his gun at Cassie Bernall and asked her the life-or-death question: &amp;quot;Do you believe in Jesus?&amp;quot; After a long hesitation, she looked to the young man, and said: &amp;quot;Yes, I love Jesus&amp;quot;. That was the last thing this 17-year-old Christian would ever say. The gunman asked her &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; She had no time to answer before she was shot to death.</description>

      <description>Romans 1:1 says, “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ,
called to be an apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God.”
We are all servants or slaves of God or servants of our own lusts and desires. People love to think of themselves as free, bold agents of change. Apple used to encourage us to Think Different. Paul boldly says he’s a “servant” or “slave” of Jesus Christ.
But Paul was called to be the unique Apostle to the Gentiles.</description>

      <description>Saved By A Sheep The ship Boyne was anchored at sea near the city of Portsmouth. On May 1st at 11 a.m., the people on the shore watched in horror as flames shot up through the deck and the royal navy ship began to burn out of control. In a few minutes the whole ship was in flames and those on board were scrambling to escape. Many died in the fire, and others were drowned trying to swim to shore.</description>

      <description>Sorry! There was never any doubt of their guilt. The two college students were caught by police as they burglarized cars on the university campus. When police searched their car they found stereo equipment linking them to eight burglaries at another campus over a hundred miles away.
Arrested, facing possible jail sentences, they were offered a “deal.” A prosecutor would drop the charges if they completed probation and apologized. Accordingly, the two paid for advertisements in their school’s newspaper and submitted apologies.</description>

      <description>TSUNAMI - The Picture of a Nightmare December 26 – the day after Christmas – is restful in many parts of the world. Gifts have been opened, relatives visited, special meals eaten. There is nothing left to do but dream of summer. After the holidays, it&amp;#039;s tempting to fantasize about packing bags and flying to exotic beaches with blue waves, palm trees, sun and sand.
So, a resort in Thailand advertises: &amp;quot;Khao Lak Beach – Five-Star Luxury Resort.</description>

      <description>The Book Seller A Christian bookseller was traveling in South America, his mule laden with the precious Scriptures. Night was beginning to fall when he saw in the distance a company of merchants. They had stopped to camp for the night. The bookseller approached them and asked if he might camp with them. They readily agreed and invited him to share their evening meal by the fire.
As they sat around the cheerful blaze after their simple supper, the Christian took a Bible from his pocket and asked permission to read to them.</description>

It was a few miles to the Christian’s house, and he found that the man was away from home and would not be back that day. But his wife, who was also a Christian, asked, “Is there anything I can do?</description>

      <description>The Doctor’s Discovery Albert was the son of Christian parents. During his early childhood he had been taught the Word of God and taught to fear of the Lord. In college he met a student who called himself an atheist and Albert soon became an atheist also. Eventually he became a skilled and popular physician. But his heart was cold toward God.
Albert spent twenty years ignoring God. However, he experienced many misgivings.</description>

      <description>The Jailbird&amp;#039;s Song On January 7, 1993 I was a broken man &amp;ndash; lost, hurt, angry, and confused. Locked in jail, my life already destroyed through drugs and crime, I had just received shattering news. The mother of my two youngest children had been murdered, stabbed to death by a male acquaintance and neighbor. Overwhelmed with grief and fear for my children, I, a hardened 41-year-old convict, stood sobbing for hours in front of everyone in the cellblock.</description>

He had also decided that day to take a law course at the University, but now here he lay, and why, oh, why this pain in his leg?
Suddenly everything changed for him.</description>

      <description>The Prodigal Son This famous story is often told with certain variations, but the original is exquisite. It stands alone in beauty and depth of meaning. For your convenience I’ll quote it here: “He said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</description>

      <description>The Right Way We should all be on our guard against being misdirected for eternity. It is vital to be certain where we will spend eternity-in heaven, or in hell. It must be one of the two places.
Many contradictory directions to heaven are given today. Many of them must be mistaken and misleading, even when given by well-meaning people. All can’t be true. There is no need for us to depend on doubtful advice.</description>

      <description>The Stairs When I was growing up, we lived in a little house with a full basement. Mom made the basement cozy with a rug covering the concrete floor and a couch and chair that we could play on. My brothers and I played down there a lot, and that was where we kept most of our toys and the things we treasured.
We went up and down those wooden stairs many times, and after a while they began to look pretty scuffed and scruffy.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is the Bible in Basic English or (BBE)?&amp;rdquo;
##The History
The Bible in Basic English was translated by Professor Samuel Henry Hooke, who was an English scholar and Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Studies at the University of London. The BBE was printed in 1965 by Cambridge Press in England. Published without any copyright notice and distributed in America, this work fell immediately and irretrievably into the public domain in the United States.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Who is Jesus Christ?&amp;rdquo; Unlike the question “Does God exist?” very few people question whether Jesus Christ existed. It is generally accepted that Jesus was truly a man who walked on the earth in Israel 2000 years ago. The debate begins when the subject of Jesus&amp;rsquo; full identity is discussed. Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man. The problem is that the Bible tells us that Jesus was infinitely more than a prophet, a good teacher, or a godly man.</description>

      <description>I was born in 1955, and came to know the Lord Jesus in 1978. You can read the story of my conversion at &amp;quot;When Angels Rejoice&amp;quot;. Since then, I have worked as an architect, an editor, and a translator, and now I work as a consultant, writer and speaker. I write business articles and stories for many sites, newspapers and magazines and give lectures on business and marketing. I am also a writer with four books on business and marketing published.</description>

## Ready for The Race {#ready-for-the-race-0}

In the late afternoon of October 30, 1987, just after I had become 19, there were many young people in my snack bar. Until that afternoon, I had been a normally healthy young man. My life existed in entertainment, partying, games and girls. I thought my life would not have any meaning without pleasure and entertainment; so I had no concern about my future. But the future about which I had given no thought was about to have a tragic beginning for me that day.

## My New Beginning {#my-new-beginning}

One of my friends in the snack bar that day knew I kept a gun under the counter. He asked me if I would lend him the gun. Without a worrying thought I handed him the gun, loaded and ready to shoot. He held the pistol in one hand; and in a very natural action spun the cylinder in which the bullets were with his other hand. I clearly recall hearing a shot. I felt the shock of the bullet running through my body. Still conscious, I recall lying on the floor and being in terrible pain.

Apparently, as he turned the cylinder, something caused one of the bullets to discharge, causing the shot. I will never know for sure how it happened. That day was the beginning of a future for me that was to be a very unpleasant journey. The bullet went across my chest and lodged in my spine, making me a paraplegic. From that day my body was paralyzed. I was unable to move below my chest. At nineteen, I who had been so full of health and energy became a handicapped individual with the prospect of a meaningless life.

## My Mind Alert {#my-mind-alert}

Many thoughts flooded into my mind during the many days I spent in the hospital. I was extremely confused. Life had no meaning for me anymore. Instead of parties, girls and entertainment, I began to live with the ghost of uncertainties and fear. Soon my body would be suffering the effects of immobility and sores would become routine as part of daily recurring difficulties.

For someone so independent as I, it was humiliating to have to depend on others for the most simple things, personal hygiene, to reach something only a few feet away, and other tasks which a healthy person takes for granted. Things that had been so easy to do now were impossible for me. I would have to become accustomed to waiting, expecting others to find time to help me

## Delusion {#delusion}

I was discharged from the hospital January, 1988\. Before going back to my home town, I sought healing through spiritism. The first person I contacted for help was called Edson Queiroz. He claimed to be able to revive the spirit of a dead German doctor, Dr. Fritz. It did not help. Quite to the contrary, my condition worsened with complications developing in my urinary track. These new difficulties required surgery by the doctors. It was many months before the problem was completely solved.

Finally I was taken back home. Arriving there was like facing a new nightmare. My mind raced about things I would not be able to do and having to endure the curiosity of others and expressions of pity from those who knew me before the accident was almost too fearful to consider.

Returning to my home town, I made another attempt to seek healing from spiritism. The frustration caused by the lack of help from this source resulted in an ulcer in my stomach. The ulcer produced a serious hemorrhage, so serious that I had to be rushed to the hospital for another operation to prevent my bleeding to death. As many people who do not know the Truth turn to spiritism or other cults, I was subjected to delusion and disillusion.

## An Unwelcome Gift {#an-unwelcome-gift}

By the time I was ready to go home, I received a gift that would cause a greater and more complete change in my life than the change caused by the shot in my chest. My sister in law gave me a Bible. At first I did not like the gift I received. At every attempt to read the Bible, instead of giving me consolation, I received words that condemned me. Even though I found words in the Bible that spoke plainly against me, I did not consider myself to be too bad a person. It was not until I read Psalm 53:3 that I began to think I must be worse than I had realized. It says, &quot;Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, not one.&quot; Like everyone born in this world, I was a lost sinner and no amount of good I could do would be sufficient to change this. I began to be puzzled - even concerned - about my condition. Could that shot have been a mere accident or was it a voice to me from God?

## Now Believing {#now-believing}

Today I believe that with God there are no accidents. I believe I can identify myself with much that I read in the Bible. For instance, it says in Psalm 119:67, &quot;Before I was afflicted I went astray.&quot; God allowed serious affliction to come into my life in order to call attention to things that are eternal. Perhaps you already have gone through some severe problems in our life. Have you learned anything from them? Or is it possible you have never had to go through much difficulty. This does not change fact that you are a sinner in need of salvation God offers. Do not let your thoughts cause God to have to speak louder to you before you decide to give thought to your eternal destiny. Do not put off settling with God about your salvation until you pass into eternity without Christ. Then it is too late to change your mind.

## Too Good - Too Bad {#too-good-too-bad}

One day I read a passage that convinced me of my sin: &quot;Christ Jesus came into world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.&quot; It was written by apostle Paul in his first letter to Timothy, chapter 1, verse 15\. Then I thought, &quot;if a man like this servant of Lord tells me he was chief of sinners, who am I that I should think of myself as righteous?&quot; That day was the beginning of my reading bible more frequently. I think my conversion was not yet completed. Before I thought I was too good to be condemned by Bible; now I was beginning to think of myself so great a sinner that I did not deserve God&#039;s goodness and mercy.

## The First Step {#the-first-step}

When reading Bible on a certain day, I found this verse: &quot;For God so loved world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; (John 3:16) I thought within myself, &quot;All I have to have eternal life is believe on the Son of God.&quot; My response was, &quot;Yes, Lord Jesus, I trust in Thee.&quot; As soon as this thought had been formed in my mind, a questioning doubt was also taking place in my soul. &quot;What about my sins; what can I do with them?&quot;

The answer for this question I found waiting for me in Psalm 103, verses 3, 10, and 12\. &quot;The Lord...who forgives all thine iniquities.. He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities...as for as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.&quot; It was only then I &quot;took a step forward&quot; that even a paraplegic could do. I reckoned myself a sinner and confessed my sins to the Lord, believing He had died on the cross for me. (1 John 1:8,9).

Well, the first step had already been taken. I had repented, changed my mind, to now think of myself as a sinner. In the same manner, I took the second step. I confessed my sin to God. It was then I got assurance from Him that my sins were forgiven. Because of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross, who died as my substitute, all my sins were forgiven. The Bible, the word of God, which at first I did not want, now assured me that I already had eternal life. &quot;He that believes on me HAS everlasting life.&quot; (John 6:47) I noticed the verb was in the present tense. Eternal life was already assured for me as a present possession. Though I had already believed on the Lord Jesus as my Savior, I still had to give myself to Him in order for Him to be my Lord, the owner of my life.

## New Light {#new-light}

In 1992 I received a tract from a publishing house called Verdades Vivas (Living Truths) and in it there was offered a bible study by mail. I decided to write and received the first lessons. It was puzzling to me to learn the people in that publishing house did not belong to any religious denomination. Until then I thought one could only become a complete Christian by joining or becoming a member of some religious organization. Not even in my furthermost imagination had I ever thought of Christians who were nothing but Christians, of any who were not members of some church, officially established organization or voluntary religious association. Soon I would learn that every one who has been converted by believing on the Lord Jesus as their Savior becomes a part of the church He bought with His own blood. They become members of His body.

Along with the bible course I received a periodical called &quot;Palavras de Edificação, Exortação, e Consolação (Words of Edification, Exhortation, and Consolation). There I found in the July-August 1992 edition, the article &quot;Handicaps&quot;. The article was telling that we all have some kind of handicap and that no one is perfect or free of some problem. But what is the positive result of our deficiencies? The Bible shows men who were &quot;handicapped&quot; in one aspect of another, but in spite of their problem, God had made them capable of being used by Him. I continued reading until I came to a paragraph the words of which struck me like a bolt of lightening.

## Learning From Jacob {#learning-from-jacob}

A good illustration of what I went through is very similar to what happened to a man in the Old Testament, the first part of the bible. His name is Jacob and it means schemer. He lived up to his name. He was one who had a neat trick up his sleeve, and one who would not let anyone get the best of him in a trade. Had God permitted him to go on in his very self-sufficient way, his life would have been a failure.

One night the angel of the Lord came down and Jacob wrestled with him in order to receive a blessing. They wrestled until the angel gave Jacob a handicap. Jacob met One with whom he could not scheme. The angel of the Lord touched Jacob&#039;s thigh and gave him a handicap, a limp that remained with him the rest of his life. You can find the story in Genesis 32:24-32\. This encounter with the angel of the Lord that left Jacob with a handicap was the turning point of his life. His handicap was a constant reminder that God was in control. At what point did Jacob receive the blessing? When he was crippled!

Those were the words I needed to cause me to give my heart entirely to the Lord Jesus, having Him not only as my Savior but also as my Lord -- the Lord of my life. I could no longer ignore &quot;so great salvation.&quot; The Bible asks, &quot;How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvaltion?&quot;. (Hebrews 2:3) Having accepted salvation from the Lord, I was beginning to learn something about His being the Lord of my life.

## Temporary Handicapped {#temporary-handicapped}

Before my conversion, before I believed on the Lord Jesus as my Savior and my Lord, the thought of not being able to walk again or being confined to a wheel chair for the rest of my life caused me much mental suffering and anguish. Attached to a wheel chair the rest of my life, living constantly with a feeling of fear and indignation, I refused even to go outside my house. Even the small portion of the world I could see from my window scared me. I isolated myself completely and the first time I went out voluntarily, pushed in my wheel chair, was to go to the neighbor&#039;s house to use the telephone. My first trip into the open air was to make a phone call to the publishing house from which I was receiving the bible study.

Today I do not consider myself an invalid. I go out, visit people, and, with the help of a special wheel chair, am able to spend some time standing. In 1993, I learned cross-stitching and began to sell my work. I also work producing cards and banners on the computer. Now I no longer say I am handicapped. I am only temporarily unable to walk. This temporary inability to walk will not last long. Soon my Savior and Lord will come and call me up to Himself in heaven. In a new body, I will not only be able to walk again but also even to fly! The Lord will change my body of humiliation, one subject to handicap. In my new home and new body, I will neither be subject to pain nor illness nor death.

## Racing Ready! {#racing-ready}

When I was going through all those exercises within my soul, somebody told me a story about a little boy whose name was Daniel. He was only seven years old, but already he had trusted the Lord Jesus as his Savior. Daniel was severely ill. He is not ill any more because the Lord took him home to heaven. God took him to the place where the Bible says, &quot;God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.&quot; (Revelation 7:17). To be there is very much desired by those who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.

The apostle Paul says of departing to be with Christ &quot;is far better.&quot; For him to live was to present Christ; should he die, he says it would be &quot;gain.&quot; (Philippians 1:21,23) Little Daniel&#039;s illness caused him to not be able to walk any more. When his father asked him who would be the one that would run the fastest in heaven, Daniel would answer immediately: &quot;Pedro and me&quot;, referring to another boy who also needs a wheel chair. When I heard that, I asked Daniel to includ me in &quot;the race&quot;, even if I had to be in third place!

When the wonderful day of glory arrives, what I expect with excitement, and being face to face with my Lord. I will ask Him, &quot;Lord Jesus, where is little Daniel? Now we can run!&quot; It says in the Bible, &quot;But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&quot; (Isaiah 40:31).

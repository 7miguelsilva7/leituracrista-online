## Christ Your Griefs Has Borne



Surely Christ your griefs has borne!

Weeping soul no longer mourn:

View Him bleeding on the tree,

Pouring out His life for thee.

Weary sinner, keep your eyes

On the atoning Sacrifice:

There the Lord upon the tree

Numbered with transgressors see.

Cast your guilty soul on Him;

Find Him mighty to redeem;

At His feet your burden lay â€”

Look your doubts and fears away.

## Are You Acquainted With the Author

“I am personally acquainted with the author.” That was the reply of a Christian when challenged by a skeptic as to the authenticity of the Bible.

There are many who have Bibles but have no personal acquaintance with the Author! How many there are who regard the Bible as merely a masterpiece of English literature, or perhaps go as far as to call it, “The good Book.”
Again, there are many involved in the production, distribution and sale of the Bible but ignorant of its message to them. An extreme example of this folly is found in the following story.

A Christian who revered and loved the Bible recently visited a major Bible wholesaler in the United States. The proprietor proudly took him by elevator to the top floor of one of his three warehouses, and from there they toured the building floor by floor, the proprietor describing to him his Bibles.

The building contained literally thousands upon thousands of Bibles of almost every size and description in versions acceptable to practically every individual, creed and denomination.

Orders flowed in continuously throughout the working hours from all over the continent; and every order was promptly processed and shipped the same day. In his community the proprietor was rightly regarded as a most successful business man, a good citizen, and incidentally, a millionaire.

On leaving the building, the visitor was presented with a Bible bound in white kid leather as a souvenir to commemorate his visit. As he accepted it and thanked the proprietor, he felt the need to ask, “And do you know the Author of this book?”
To this the proprietor gave no reply, but quickly changed the subject. Evidently the correct answer to his question would have been, “No.”
The Bible is divinely given to be a lamp to our feet and a light to our path (see Psalm 119:105). To possess, handle or make sell the Bible while closing our ears to its divine message, is very foolish.

“And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3).

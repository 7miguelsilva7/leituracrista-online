## The Right Way

We should all be on our guard against being misdirected for eternity. It is vital to be certain where we will spend eternity-in heaven, or in hell. It must be one of the two places.

Many contradictory directions to heaven are given today. Many of them must be mistaken and misleading, even when given by well-meaning people. All can’t be true. There is no need for us to depend on doubtful advice. God has given simple directions to heaven.

God doesn’t say “do your best,” or “observe the golden rule,” or “try to be good.” He makes it clear that none of these will lead us to heaven. We have all wandered too far from God for that to help us.

The Word of God points to Christ as the only way. Jesus Himself says: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me” (John 14:6).

He suffered at Calvary, not merely as a martyr, but as the one who suffered for the sins of others. He washes away sin by His own blood on the cross. Now that He is risen from the dead, He is proclaimed to all as the only Saviour. The way to receive blessing for the present and to enter heaven for eternity is by trusting Him.

The Bible says: “To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43). Could words be plainer?

True wisdom is to listen to the sure directions of the Word of God and so escape the dreadful danger of being misdirected.

“There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; but the end there of are the ways of death” (Proverbs 14:12).

“He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on Him” (John 3:36).

“I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved” (John 10:9)

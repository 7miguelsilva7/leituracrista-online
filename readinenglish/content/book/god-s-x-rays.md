## God’s X-Rays

God has His spiritual X-rays!

“The Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). “His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men” (Psalm 11:4). “Thou understandest my thought afar off” (Psalm 139:2). “I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins” (Jeremiah 17:10).

Would you and I like our inner history to be published or revealed? God’s X-rays reveal all. And if sin is not blotted out by atonement, the “plates” as it were will come up for judgment. No one can play with sin: it is a dreadful reality. God knows what we desire—imagine—think. He will bring every work into judgment.

Are you unmoved? As the tubercular spot is shown up by the X-rays, so your hidden sin will come to light at God’s investigation.

“Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:24).

An evil man “hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten, He hideth His face; He will never see” (Psalm 10:11).

God’s answer is clear: “They consider not in their hearts that I remember” (Hosea 7:2). “I know the things that come into your mind” (Ezekiel 11:5).

Many who say, “I have done no one any harm… I have a clean sheet… I stand as good a chance as any,” boast unthinkingly. Some even stifle consciousness of wrong by vain talk. Let there be a deep sense of God’s permanent record that is being made, and they will speak less of themselves.

God’s X-rays have a subduing effect. They cannot lie. Nothing escapes His notice. Nothing is too small for His piercing investigation. Neither you nor I can blur it out, or blot it out. But “the blood of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).

There is a hope, a sure hope; there is one, and only one. All else fails. The blood of Christ never fails. Let guilt be acknowledged; let the precious atonement of the one Redeemer be realized. Then, and only then, there is “peace with God.”

Reader, God’s X-rays prevent all self-confidence. But the very One who knew all your guilt has provided complete salvation at infinite cost. God reigns through righteousness. It is grace abounding, grace triumphant. You and I have no “chance” of salvation in ourselves; but we are welcome NOW to a sure salvation in Christ.

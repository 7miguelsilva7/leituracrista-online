## TSUNAMI - The Picture of a Nightmare {#tsunami-the-picture-of-a-nightmare-0}

December 26 – the day after Christmas – is restful in many parts of the world. Gifts have been opened, relatives visited, special meals eaten. There is nothing left to do but dream of summer. After the holidays, it&#039;s tempting to fantasize about packing bags and flying to exotic beaches with blue waves, palm trees, sun and sand.

So, a resort in Thailand advertises: &quot;Khao Lak Beach – Five-Star Luxury Resort. Enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime beach vacation!&quot;

Once in a lifetime. This year, for many it was.

Later that week the television showed movies and photos of the tsunami and the news reported from the same beach:

&quot;Miles of shattered hotels along Thailand&#039;s Khao Lak beach, a magnet for tourists, began yielding up dead, bloated, gashed and mangled bodies. The 770 dead so far counted at Khao Lak came from dozens of countries….&quot;

The dream vacation became a nightmare for thousands.

## Tsunami – The unexpected disaster {#tsunami-the-unexpected-disaster}

One minute, families relaxed on the warm sand, parents watched their children run and play happily. The next, many fled in terror as huge killer waves rocketed over the beaches, sweeping life as they knew it out to sea.

Over 150,000 people died that day, millions were homeless and orphans of the tsunami were counted in thousands. Families, rich and poor, were torn apart, some to go home bereaved forever, some to go to eternity.

## An even greater flood {#an-even-greater-flood}

The biblical account of the early days of the earth tells of a massive global flood that wiped out the entire world population except for eight people. God sent that flood to destroy the wickedness of the earth, and gave instruction to Noah years before to build a boat for safety. (Genesis 6, 7)

Why would God destroy His own creation? The Bible explains that. God created humanity in His own image, to be like Him, for a relationship with Him. But as a whole humans had turned away from Him, in heart and in likeness. We were no longer what He created us to be.

After that flood, God promised never again to destroy the entire earth that way, and displayed His rainbow to symbolize that promise.

## What about the future? {#what-about-the-future}

But He does promise that He will again completely wipe out the earth as we know it, this time with fire. Noah was a fresh start to God&#039;s original purpose – to have humanity for His friend – but again we humans have turned away from our Maker, pursuing our own agendae rather than Him. &quot;All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one to his own way, but the Lord has laid on Him (Jesus) the iniquity of us all.&quot; (Isaiah 53:6)

Now the Lord Jesus is a Shepherd saving lost sheep. He took our place in judgement-fire on the cross, so that He could open a way to safety for any individual who seeks Him. But just like before the first flood, there is only a predetermined amount of time to take advantage of that safety. &quot;Now is the accepted time… now is the day of salvation.&quot; (2 Corinthians 6:2)

After Noah boarded the ark to safety, the flood ripped away the lives of everyone else, but those who took shelter in the ark. The Lord Jesus warns us in Luke 17:26-27, &quot;As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.&quot;

## A higher ground {#a-higher-ground}

In Asia, lack of a tsunami warning system was blamed for the unpreparedness and devastation. However, many who in some way could find a shelter in a higher ground did that and saved their lives.

As to what concerns eternity, God has given us warning in His Word, a warning to escape and find shelter in His Father&#039;s house above, before the door to heaven be shut forever. Shortly after Jesus takes His people Home to safety, fiery judgment will consume the world (Hebrews 10:27, 2 Peter 3:7), and there will be no more relief organizations, and no survivors.

&quot;Today if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts... How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?&quot; (Hebrews 3:15, 2:3).

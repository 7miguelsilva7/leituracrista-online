## Only One Church

John Wesley once, in a dream, found himself at the gates of hell. He knocked, and asked who were within. 

“Are there any Roman Catholics here?” he asked.

“Yes,” was the answer.

“Any Presbyterians?” he asked, and again the answer was, “Yes.”

“Are there any Welseyans here?”

“Yes, we have some of those, too,” came the answer.

Disappointed and dismayed, especially by the last reply, he turned his step upward and at last came to the gates of heaven. Here he repeated the same questions.

“Any Wesleyans here?” he anxiously inquired. The answer was, “No.”

And as he named the other denominations, to his dismay, each time the answer was, “No.”

“Then whom do you have here?” he asked in desperation.

“We know nothing here of any of those names you have mentioned,” said the angel. “They are all Christians here-born again people. Of these we have a great multitude which no man can number, gathered out of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues.”

Down through the centuries there have been bitter arguments over religion, and especially the question: which church is right? Nothing is more irritating than to hear someone insist that only members of his church or denomination will get to heaven. How foolish that is, when the Bible makes it so plain that Christ is the way to heaven, and not the church.

Be sure that God will not ask the sinner: “What church did you join?” But He will inquire, “What have you done with Christ?” The only members of any church or denomination who will be in heaven will be those who as lost sinners have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour.

But there is a church of which every member, according to the Bible, will be in heaven. It is called “the church of God, which He hath purchased with His own blood” (Acts 20:28). According to the New Testament, a person doesn’t become a member of this Church until he knows the Lord Jesus Christ as his own Saviour.

The Church began at Jerusalem after the Lord Jesus was taken back to heaven. Universally it includes all the believers in the Lord Jesus Christ throughout the world. At the second coming of Christ this universal Church will be taken up to heaven to be forever with the Lord. In that day, “The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain [all Christians, both the dead and living] shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

Are you a member of this one true Church?

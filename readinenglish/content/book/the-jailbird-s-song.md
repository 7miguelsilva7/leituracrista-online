## The Jailbird&#039;s Song {#the-jailbird-s-song-0}

On January 7, 1993 I was a broken man -- lost, hurt, angry, and confused. Locked in jail, my life already destroyed through drugs and crime, I had just received shattering news. The mother of my two youngest children had been murdered, stabbed to death by a male acquaintance and neighbor. Overwhelmed with grief and fear for my children, I, a hardened 41-year-old convict, stood sobbing for hours in front of everyone in the cellblock. How, I wondered, had I come to that point, and what was going to happen next?

## The Drunk&#039;s Kid {#the-drunk-s-kid}

I was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1951\. My father was an alcoholic, and our story was about the same as that of most alcohol-plagued families. Money which should have bought groceries and clothing for us kids was spent day after day, night after night in the local bar. I was known in town as the drunk&#039;s kid, recognizable by my raggy clothes and holey shoes. Once when I was hungry and unable to find anything else in the house, I ate an entire jar of mayonnaise. I got so sick afterwards, that even today I cannot eat mayonnaise.

I loved my dad, and he must have loved me, because he named me, his youngest, after his best drinking buddy, a local police captain named Gilbert Pomeroy. He sometimes took me to the bar with him; there I sat for hours while he laughed and drank and hung out. His pals often took pity on me and bought me sodas to help me pass the time. Weary of the scene, I&#039;d beg him to take me home. He&#039;d always say &quot;Just a little while longer.&quot;

## On The Streets {#on-the-streets}

He died when I was nine. My mother raised me as best she could -- she sometimes took me to a Baptist church, and she tried to make me go to school. But I never got past 7th grade. After beating up a teacher and principal, I walked out and never came back. For some reason they didn&#039;t try to find me, even though I was only fourteen, below the legal age to quit school.

From that point I was on my own. I lived on and off the streets of Paterson, and lied about my age to get work. I thought I was tough and cool, and I gained respect on the streets, but my heart was empty. Later on I developed a drug addiction which lasted for 20 years.

## Drugs {#drugs}

I married and became the father of two beautiful children, Dottie and Gilbert Jr., whom I loved very much. But because of my drug addiction I lost everything I valued: first my sanity, then control, then in 1979 my wife and children. I missed Dottie&#039;s and Gilbert&#039;s childhood.

Finally I lost my freedom. Along with drug involvement comes an outlaw mentality and lifestyle, and my life was no exception. Drug dealing and other illegal activities kept me in and out of jail for years.

During that time I had another long-term relationship, resulting in two more children, Rebecca and Robert. When Rebecca and Robert were 5 and 6, while I was in jail, their mother was killed. They were left alone, and I couldn&#039;t do a thing about it.

## Bible Studies {#bible-studies}

I had been attending a Bible study in the Morris County Jail, more from curiosity and boredom than anything else. But after this tragedy my attitude changed. Were there really answers, was there help in this &quot;Christian&quot; stuff? The man who conducted the Bible studies, known to everyone as &quot;Brother Dick,&quot; visited and talked to me about the Lord Jesus Christ. That week he showed a movie, the film &#039;Jesus,&#039; on the life of Christ.

I was mesmerized by the story of this Man, this God come in person to His creation. His humility, His kindness, His love touched my heart. I watched, transfixed, as He was mocked, crowned King with a thorny halo, beaten, and nailed to a cross. This, then, was the answer! Jesus was taking the punishment for MY sin, the sin that had brought me this present degradation and sorrow. And His resurrection was my hope as well, the hope of a new life and an eternal future.

## The Savior {#the-savior}

At the end of the movie Dick asked if anyone wanted to surrender to the Lord. Hardly realizing what I was doing, I found myself on my feet with tears in my eyes. That night, January 14, 1993, with a lost soul and a broken heart, I asked the Savior to forgive and help me, redeem me, and take over my life. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, &quot;If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away, behold, all things are become new.&quot;

My new Master began right away. Guards and inmates alike were amazed to realize they could no longer count on me to steal food for them from the kitchen. And, while the pain of my recent loss was still fresh, I had peace instead of despair. And the Lord not only changed me, but He began straightening out my messed up life as well.

## My Children {#my-children}

My greatest dread at the moment was that my children would be separated and placed in foster homes. I frantically tried to locate them, and find someone to look after them, but was frustrated by jail regulations about phones and outside contacts. Unexpectedly, their aunt offered to keep them until I could care for them again. God had arranged what I, in my incarcerated helplessness, could not.

Then I heard about a Christian drug recovery retreat, America&#039;s Keswick Colony of Mercy, in Whiting, New Jersey. The Colony is not a traditional rehabilitation program, but rather a place where men are taught to read, understand, and live the Scriptures. Dick assisted me with the application process, and I was accepted, pending the outcome of my case.

## Outside Prison Walls {#outside-prison-walls}

After sentencing, I spent several months in prison, then returned to the county jail to await my release to the Keswick Colony. A four-day interval before I could be admitted to the Colony threatened to force me back to prison, but Dick offered to act as my custodian in his home and transport me personally to Keswick. Surprisingly, the judge agreed.

It was a warm June weekend when I began my walk with God outside prison walls. I went to church meetings, and my oldest daughter Dottie brought her little girl Desiree, along with my own little Rebecca and Robert, to see me. Witnessing our tearful and tender reunion was the woman who later would become my wife, though neither of us would have believed it at the time.

## Christian Pills {#christian-pills}

Down at Keswick I had a major adjustment to make. Forty-one years of street life had left me unprepared for hanging around with Christians all the time. &quot;What is with these people?&quot; I wondered. &quot;They act like they&#039;ve been taking Christian pills.&quot; I hardly knew the difference between a chapter and a verse in the Bible, let alone any Christian doctrine, so it was all pretty strange to me at first. And the humility part! Humility was definitely not my thing, but the Lord faithfully took me in hand, and brothers admonished and taught me from Scripture and by example. I was also puzzled by the insincerity and hypocrisy of some, but the Lord did not allow that to stumble me, but rather let me see it for what it was.

After three months I needed to figure out what to do next. The program was only 90 days, and I realized that a return to my old environment could very well mean a return to my old ways. Yet I wanted to be with my children. As I prayed and pondered my dilemma, a letter arrived from Dick inviting me to live at his house until I received further direction from the Lord.

## God&#039;s Plan {#god-s-plan}

Once I settled in there, I took stock of my situation: no job, no home, no driver&#039;s license, no money, and no way to care for my kids. Things didn&#039;t look optimistic, but God had a plan, and He gave me peace. I couldn&#039;t help wondering though, &quot;How is this new life ever going to work out?&quot;

In the next town Dick&#039;s daughters were wondering too. &quot;What can he do? He seems like he&#039;s in a hopeless situation.&quot; &quot;Oh, he&#039;ll probably find someone and get married. Give him time.&quot;

## A Woman For You {#a-woman-for-you}

If it hadn&#039;t been for the kids, I wouldn&#039;t have cared about getting married. But back in the county jail Dick had told me, &quot;Trust me. The Lord has a woman for you.&quot; I was skeptical, but one day sitting in the gazebo at Keswick I had remembered his words, and talked to my new Friend about it. &quot;Show me, Lord,&quot; I prayed, &quot;if that is really true. I&#039;ll wait on You.&quot;

My new life was full. I rode trains each weekend to visit my children, and sometimes brought them back to spend the night and attend Sunday school. I borrowed a toolbox and walked around town knocking on doors, a sort of itinerant handyman, offering to do repairs. Although this was unheard of in that community, God showed His favor and people hired me. I began a small roofing business, and finally my driving privileges were restored.

## Can This Be? {#can-this-be}

From time to time I crossed paths with Lyn, Dick&#039;s oldest daughter. I had met her previously in the jail where she taught English as a Second Language and visited the Bible studies with her guitar. Though I found her attractive, she struck me as an arrogant snob, probably because, burned out on ex-convicts&#039; self-made problems, she went out of her way to avoid me.

We became friends anyway, and one day, after helping her shovel snow from her driveway, I couldn&#039;t get her out of my mind. &quot;Can this be?&quot; I asked my Lord. &quot;It can,&quot; He assured me. I hesitated, but knew I could never rest until I asked her. I tried to get her out on a date, but she was always too busy. Finally, unable to stand the suspense any longer, I called her early one morning before she went to work, and asked her to marry me.

## Time To Pray {#time-to-pray}

&quot;Give me the day to pray about it,&quot; she answered, &quot;but I don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about.&quot; And I didn&#039;t. The same God who spoke to me about her, had also opened her heart to me, though we had never gone out on a single date.

Three weeks before our wedding my license was revoked again. Paying old tickets had triggered the resurrection of a 1977 driving violation, resulting in automatic suspension of my license. I wondered if I should tell Lyn, fearing she would cancel the wedding, but I mustered my courage and broke the news. We prayed together, and waited for God&#039;s deliverance. Little did we know then, this would become the pattern for our life together: frightening results from the past, followed by prayer, God&#039;s strength and deliverance, then deeper blessing. Psalm 50:15 has been our motto: &quot;Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.&quot;

The next day a roofing company around the corner offered me a job. There I worked until my license was again restored, and I was able to resume my own roofing business.

## Married {#married}

On April 17, 1994 Lyn and I were married, with great joy. Two months later, at the end of the school year, my dream came true as my children Rebecca and Robert moved home with us. The following February Kathleen Elizabeth was added to our family, and two years later tiny Victoria was born, three months early. Her name reflects the truth we have learned, and continue to learn, under the loving hand of our God, our Saviour, our Lord, and Friend: &quot;Faith is the victory that overcomes the world.&quot; (from 1 John 5:4).

Through many crises, too numerous to mention, He has brought us safely. He has never disappointed the trust we placed in Him, and He never will. See Psalm 34:22\.

I came to know my Lord and Saviour at age 41\. Looking back on my life, there are many things I regret, but what I regret most was that I lived those 41 years without knowing Him.

Joel 2:25 says the Lord will restore the years the locust has eaten. Forty-one years of my life were consumed by sin and lawlessness, but God continues to restore that which He &quot;took not away&quot; (Psalm 69:4).

&quot;He brought me up out of a horrible pit ... and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps. He has put a new song in my mouth -- praise to our God.&quot; Psalm 40:2,3\. &quot;This is my story, this is my song Praising my Savior all the day long.&quot;

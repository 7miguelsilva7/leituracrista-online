## A stealthy attack from a hidden enemy

When I was in junior high school, my uncle invited me and some of my friends over to his house for supper. For dessert, among other things, was a plate of figs. Yum! Figs and dates and raisins are my favorite dried fruits. They come originally from mid-east countries like Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, among others.

While we were eating the figs, one of the boys said to my uncle, &quot;We&#039;ve been studying about bacteria at school. These figs are sweet and sticky. I wonder if we could see any bacteria on them if we looked at them through your microscope?&quot;

Now I knew that moldy cheese, food gone bad and stagnant water all had bacteria, but I was sure dried figs wouldn&#039;t have any.

My uncle said, &quot;Let&#039;s find out.&quot; He brought his microscope out and adjusted it on the table. Then with a razor blade he shaved off a thin layer from the outside of the fig. We all watched closely as he carefully placed the shaving on a glass slide and slipped it in place under the powerful scope. After looking at it through the microscope for a minute or two he said, &quot;Come and see for yourselves.&quot;

When it was my turn to look I saw two or three things that were moving. &quot;Ugh! Who&#039;d have thought there were bugs on those figs?&quot; I said in disgust. They looked like bugs to me, but my uncle said they were bacteria.

Bacteria are a tiny form of life. Some are so small that 50,000 lined up in a row would cover only one inch. Yet they are very important, and without them life as we know it could not exist. They are present in water and air, and a teaspoonful of garden soil contains billions of them. They are even in the figs or the hamburger you eat.

Just what do they do? One main purpose is to break down other materials. Bacteria take chemicals from these materials and change them into forms that can be used by other living organisms. For instance, gardeners often make &quot;compost piles&quot; of grass clippings, leaves, kitchen garbage, weeds and other plant material, sometimes adding dirt and manure.

Bacteria attack these materials, and the process of breaking them down generates heat. Different kinds of bacteria work this material over and over and, helped by the heat, change most of it into rich, soft humus. When added to gardens, this humus helps to produce fine crops.

Other kinds of bacteria convert material into ammonia which is picked up by the roots of plants. Some bacteria change materials to carbon dioxide which is released into the air for use by plants and trees. Still other bacteria are used to make butter, cheese, vinegar, yogurt and many other food products.

You have many billions of bacteria inside your body. Most of the body&#039;s bacteria are helpful and necessary to maintain life --one of the most important functions being the digestion of food. Without them much of the food you eat could not be used by your body.

But some of the body&#039;s bacteria are harmful, causing sickness and disease. Some harmful bacteria live on your teeth and others on your skin when they are not carefully cleaned. Cavities in your teeth are caused by bacteria, and when you cut yourself, those on your skin can cause infection or blood poisoning. And can kill you.

After the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center in New York City (WTC NYC), authorities expected terrorists could use harmful bacteria as their next weapon. It was no longer a question of whether a major bioterrorist attack would occur, but when.

A nuclear bomb is very difficult to produce, but biological weapons are not so difficult to manufacture, especially if the terrorist does not care he will die by manipulating dangerous bacteria. Bioterrorism is distinguished not only by its mode of killing, but also by the potential scale of destruction. Many more can be killed by tinny anthrax spores than by a typical car bomb.

In 1993 the US Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) issued a report on weapons of mass destruction, and anthrax is one of them. Anthrax is a disease of cattle and sheep caused by Bacillus anthracis, and can also kill humans. The pneumonic form kills more than 90 per cent of its victims if left untreated.

Only one hundred kilograms of anthrax spores could kill the population of a entire city in one attack. The government, the army or regular procedures cannot do much to prevent this. It is a hidden enemy that uses no army, no bombs or regular weapons.

A light plane flying over a major city, carrying anthrax spores and equipped with a crop sprayer, could deliver a fatal dose to kill millions. Anthrax spores left in the tunnels of an underground railway system, where wind created by passing trains would dry them and blow them around, could also kill thousands.

Although the US government has adequate plans to cope with floods, earthquakes, or a car bomb, there is no coordinated public health infrastructure to deal with the medical consequences of bioterrorism.

The anthrax spores multiply, and then spread to the tissues, releasing toxins as they go. The first symptoms of anthrax resemble those of flu: headaches, fevers, aching muscles and coughing. Inhalation anthrax infection can start out like a common cold before acute symptoms such as severe breathing problems and shock.

Infection by consuming contaminated food is characterized by inflammation of the intestinal tract, leading to vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea. Antibiotics can cure patients in the earlier stages of the disease. Without antibiotics, death from hemorrhage, respiratory failure or toxic shock follows within a few days.

It is not easy to live knowing there are hidden enemies around you. Terrorists are people like everybody else living in the neighborhood. You never know who they are or what they are going to do. They may even look nice and respectful.

But there is an enemy that is more dangerous than Osama bin Laden or any other terrorist. I am talking about Satan, who does great harm to us. The Bible tells us that he &quot;as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8). Because he is a spiritual enemy, you have to count upon spiritual advice to know where he is and how he acts.

Besides that enemy that is without, there is an enemy within. Anthrax is invisible without a good microscope. So is this other enemy. Worst than a terrorist and even more dangerous than anthrax. I am talking about sin. And we cannot see how it works, without a different kind of microscope, a spiritual one.

&quot;Now, what has the microscope done?&quot; my uncle asked. We all knew that it hadn&#039;t done anything except open our eyes so we could see the actual condition of the figs.

&quot;Hey, it&#039;s better to know the truth than to be deceived,&quot; he said. &quot;But by the looks on your faces, I think you&#039;d rather not know the truth so you could still enjoy the figs!&quot;

I&#039;ve never forgotten that evening with my uncle, and I sometimes think the Bible is like a microscope for us, because it shows us the truth about everything. It exposes the true condition of our hearts and the true condition of the world in which we live. A world where death is always around us.

One of the things the Bible tells us is that by nature our hearts are &quot;deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked&quot; (Jeremiah 17:9). And the point is that this is true for the terrorist&#039;s heart, and it is true for yours and mine as well!

Then it tells us the other side of the truth. &quot;The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin&quot; (1 John 1:7).

If you believe both sides of the truth that God has told us in these verses and honestly receive them into your heart, you will be washed clean from all your sins. This makes you fit for the presence of God in heaven through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His precious blood shed on the cross.

Have you let God&#039;s microscope expose the truth of what&#039;s in your heart? &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart.&quot; Jeremiah 17:9-10

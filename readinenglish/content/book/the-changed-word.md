## The Changed Word

An old man who lived in the Adirondack mountains lay dying, and he asked an old friend, a neighbor, to go for a man he knew to be a Christian. He needed to know how to be saved.

It was a few miles to the Christian’s house, and he found that the man was away from home and would not be back that day. But his wife, who was also a Christian, asked, “Is there anything I can do?”

“Old Jack’s dying, ma’am, and he wants to know how to be saved.”

“Just tell him this: ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.’ If he comes to Christ as a sinner, He will never cast him out.”

“Ma’am,” he said, “will you say that again? I want to get it straight.”

“‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,’ and if he will come to Him just as he is, he will not be turned away.”

The old man went away. As he was going towards home he said to himself, “I don’t like that word ‘sinners.’ I don’t think old Jack is such a bad man. He used to chop wood for the neighbors and go for the doctor when anyone was sick, and he’s done a lot of good. When I get home I’m not going to tell it to him just like that.”

When he got back he said, “Jack, the man wasn’t home but I saw his wife and she gave me the directions. She told me that Christ Jesus came into the world to save people.”

“Didn’t she say ‘sinners’?”

“Well, I guess that’s what she did say, but I didn’t want to call you a sinner. I stuck up for you!”

“Abe, don’t talk to me like that. Since you’ve been gone I’ve been thinking back to when I was a boy and we used to sing:

Just as I am, without one plea

But that Thy blood was shed for me.

And that Thou bid’st me come to Thee.

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

And I’m going to come just like that. Now, if that is the message, I can die happy.”

Yes, old Jack had to come to Jesus just as he was. Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of God, was born in a manger, and went all the way to the cross of Calvary. There He died, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God. If you will only come to Him as a sinner and receive Him as your Saviour, you can say, “He died for me.”

Come now, just as you are, and where you are. Do not wait. Soon it will be too late!

## New York World Trade Center Under Attack! {#new-york-world-trade-center-under-attack-0}

Tuesday, September 11, 2001\. It is 8:45 a.m. in New York City. The morning sun hits the twin towers of World Trade Center, where thousands of people are working. Suddenly American Airlines Flight 11 Boeing 767, hijacked by terrorists, slams into the north tower of the World Trade Center. The airplane was en route from Boston&#039;s Logan Airport to Los Angeles International with 92 people onboard. Like a bomb, the explosion is followed by a fire, killing many people, even before they had noticed what was going on.

## &quot;I saw about 15 people jump out of the windows&quot;. {#i-saw-about-15-people-jump-out-of-the-windows}

In horror, the world watches in the TV the upper section of the building in flames while many are dying due to the terrorists attack. Hundreds of people try to get out using the stairways, but many are trapped in their offices by the fire. From the windows they call for help. &quot;I saw about 15 people jump out of the windows. You&#039;d hear a gasp in the crowd, and you&#039;d look up, and the person would still fall for about 10 or 15 seconds. Some flailed their arms, some kept them straight.&quot; - reported an eyewitness.

A man working in his office on the 72nd floor of the Trade Centre told that his desk was flying from one side of the office to the other due to the swaying of the tower. It took him 1 hour and 20 minutes to get down to the ground. He said that the plane that went into his tower went in around the 85th floor.

## War and grief {#war-and-grief}

But a well planned terrorism action is going on. Approximately 18 minutes later, millions watching TV all over the world can see when United Airlines Flight 175, also a Boeing 767 going from Boston to Los Angeles with 65 people onboard, hits the south tower of the World Trade Center. Chaos follows. All New York city bridges and tunnels are closed. A terrorist attack on the United States was on course. War and grief came suddenly into the lives of the nation.

## The Pentagon {#the-pentagon}

While this was going on in New York City, American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 enroute from Dulles Airport outside Washington to Los Angeles with 58 passengers and six crew members, crashes into the Pentagon. One of the building&#039;s five sides collapses. More than one thousand people are dead under the debris. The headquarters of United States military power was hit by terrorists.

## Hijacked Planes {#hijacked-planes}

Another airplane, United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 en route from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco with 38 passengers and seven crew members, crashes just north of the Somerset County Airport, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. People fear the hijacked plane was shot down by American missiles before it could hit its target.

## Camp David and Middle East {#camp-david-and-middle-east}

Shortly before impact, a passenger called on his cell phone from a locked bathroom: &quot;We are being hijacked, we are being hijacked! &quot; At this time there was concern the plane was headed to Camp David, where Muhammad Anwar al-Sadat, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, met with Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, from September 5 to September 17, 1978, and have agreed on the peace in the Middle East.

## Hundreds are trapped {#hundreds-are-trapped}

At 10:05 a.m. the south tower of the World Trade Center collapses in a plume of ash and debris. About twenty minutes later, the World Trade Center&#039;s north tower collapses. Besides hundreds trapped in the building, about 200 firefighters who were trying to save them have been killed and 78 police officers were missing at the end of the day. At 5:25 p.m. Seven World Trade Center, a 47-story tower, collapses from ancillary damage.

&quot;I could feel debris up to my knees&quot;, said a woman who was in a street near the World Trade Center when the twin towers collapsed. &quot;People were throwing up. People were yelling &#039;I&#039;m going to die.&#039; Other people were yelling &#039;I&#039;m not going to die.&#039; I was very touched by how helpful people were&quot;.

## Death at any moment {#death-at-any-moment}

Those people could not imagine what they would face, when they went to work that morning. Death was waiting for many of them. We don&#039;t like to think about death, but we know that traveling in cars or just walking down the street can bring each one of us very close to death. Death cannot be avoided, but are you ready if your time comes today? It is surprising how many people do not care what comes after death. God has said, &quot;It is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment&quot; (Hebrews 9:27).

## Escape route {#escape-route}

This judgment is for the sins that we have all committed, but God has prepared a way for you and me to have our sins forgiven. It is through the death of His beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who bore the punishment on the cross for the sins of those who will accept Him as their Saviour. &quot;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace&quot; (Ephesians 1:7).

## Be Ready! {#be-ready}

Other terrorists tried to attack World Trade Center before. The buildings had many security systems and vigilance, but no one would ever expect this. You might be miles away from the WTC towers, but my hope is that you will not be careless about death and the judgement that comes afterward for those who are still in their sins. &quot;Prepare to meet thy God&quot; (Amos 4:12). Prepare now while you can by believing that Jesus loves you and died for you. &quot;Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered&quot; (Romans 4:7).

God is speaking in drastic measures to this world, and each and every one of us needs to be reminded of how frail life is. He is in command. These events were allowed by Him, and He is speaking. Are you listening to Him? We all know that our time on this earth is very short. The Lord&#039;s coming is near. Are you ready to meet Him? If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, my prayer is that you might be brought to the realization that He has been in charge of all events, and may understand that you are a sinner in need of a Saviour. There is only One Who can save you from your sins. &quot;There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&quot; 1 Timothy 2:5.

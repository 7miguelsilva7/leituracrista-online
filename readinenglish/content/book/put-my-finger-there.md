## Put My Finger There

Feeble and blind, the old man in a nursing home knew his life was fast slipping away. One great worry tormented his mind: What can I do to be saved? Poor man, what could he do to be saved? He could only lie there and fret because of his helplessness.

He had a little granddaughter who often came in to read to him, and one day she brought her Bible. She started reading the first chapter of the first epistle of John. She came to the seventh verse: “And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

The old man sat up and stopped the little girl, saying eagerly, “Is that there, my dear?”

“Yes, Grandpa.”

“Then read it to me again; I never heard the like before.”

The little girl read again: “The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

“You are quite sure that is really there?”

“Yes, quite sure!”

“Then take my hand and put my finger there, for I should like to feel it.”

So she took the old blind man’s hand and placed his bony finger on the verse. He said, “Now read it to me again.”

The little girl read softly, “The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

Again he asked anxiously, “You are quite sure that is there?”

“Yes, Grandpa; quite sure!”

“Then, if anyone should ask how I died, tell them I died in the faith of these words: ‘The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.’”

Peacefully, trustfully, the old man lay back on the pillow and, with his hand still on the wonderful verse he had just learned, he silently passed into the presence of Him whose blood “cleanseth us from all sin.”

Helpless, hopeless, unable to do anything to save himself, what relief it was to learn that the Lord Jesus had done it all for him.

It may seem to some that “that is all right for the poor old man; he couldn’t do anything else, but those who are strong and capable should work for their salvation should do something to earn it.”

Not so. Physical strength or mental ability has nothing to do with the salvation of a soul. The strongest and the wisest must come to the Lord Jesus Christ just as the old man did, simply believing in His work on the cross of Calvary and receiving all the benefit of that work. It was not “to as many as worked for it,” but “as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name” (John 1:12).

## Let Your Bucket Down!

The great Amazon River pours out so mighty a stream of fresh water into the Atlantic that near its mouth, for miles out of sight of land, a deep layer of fresh water covers the ocean.
Many years ago a sailing ship left Eu­rope for a South American port, and due to storms it took so long that the water on board began to give out. The crew rationed the water, but in spite of every effort, they soon found themselves with their last water tank empty.

A day or two later, when stranded in a hot climate, to their great joy and relief they sighted another ship. When near enough to signal, they ran up their flags announcing: “We’re dying for lack of water.”

To their astonishment, the reply that came back quickly seemed to mock them: “Water all around you; let your bucket down.”

Little did they know that they were just then crossing the mighty Amazon’s cur­rent, and instead of being in saltwater, they were actually sailing in fresh — freshwater all around them though out of sight of land!

## Surrounded By God’s Love

You may be crying out, “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30), little realizing that the ocean of God’s love is all around you. “Let your bucket down!” “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved” (Acts 16:31).

“Say not in thine heart … Who shall go up for us to heaven … who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it? … The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. … For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (Romans 10:6; Deu­teronomy 30:12-14; Romans 10:8-13).

“If thou knewest the gift of God … thou would­est have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water” (John 4:10).

“Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:13-14).

“He that cometh to Me shall never hun­ger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst” (John 6:35).

“Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat … without money and without price” (Isaiah 55:1).

“He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. … And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely” (Revelation 22:1,17).
